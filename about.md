  title: Our Goal
  text_content: The Linking Infrastructure, Finance, and Farms to Cashew (LIFFT-Cashew)
    is a sub-regional project designed to create a more integrated and durable regional
    network in the Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau cashew production zone (SeGaBi
    Zone). <br>We want to enhance the cultivation of cashews and the processing, and
    selling of cashew products in the local and international markets. LIFFT-Cashew
    is implemented by Shelter For Life International with funding from the United
    States Department of Agriculture. We are working with partners to facilitate access
    to agricultural finance to cashew producers and processors, rapid flow of finance,
    and investment in the cashew value chain in the SeGaBi Zone.

    <p>We take an integrated approach along the cashew value chain, with activities in the following areas:</p>
                <ul class="list theme-colored check pt-0">
                  <li  style="font-size: 17px;"><b>INFRASTRUCTURE</b>: Construction and rehabilitation of rural roads to facilitate the flow of cashew nuts</li>
                  <li style="font-size: 17px;"><b>ACCESS TO FINANCE</b>: Collaboration with financial institutions to increase financial services to cashew producers and processors</li>
                  <li style="font-size: 17px;"><b>MARKET ACCESS</b>: Improvement of the bargaining power of cashew producers, post-production, and handling, and strengthening farm management through the establishment and increase of Cashew Marketing Associations (CMAs, similar to producer cooperatives)</li>
                  <li style="font-size: 17px;"><b>ON-FARM PRACTICES</b>: Improvement of agricultural techniques and establishment of cashew demonstration farms</li>
                </ul>

    title: THE CHALLENGE
    text_content: The SeGaBi cashew production zone of West Africa encompasses parts
      of the Gambia, the Casamance region of Senegal, and most of Guinea-Bissau. This
      agro-ecological zone produces over 222,000 metric tons of raw cashew nut annually,
      however, only 1.2% of raw cashew nuts produced are processed locally, and most
      are sent for processing in other countries such as India and Vietnam. This weakens
      the regional cashew value chain, leaving many farmers without economic opportunities
      and stagnating market infrastructure and financial services.

    title: THE SOLUTION

      markets.

    title: PROJECT GOALS
    text_content: The LIFFT-Cashew project will create durable trade infrastructure,
      increase access to financial services, organize and train smallholder farmers
      to increase production and bargaining power, and build the capacity of local
      processors to add value to kernels in the SeGaBi cashew production zone. As
      a result, the program will benefit smallholder farmers, a range of processors,
      and a variety of other businesses along the cashew value chain.
